# Web Storage First Assignment

1. What is `localStorage`?

- Answer: `localStorage` is a JavaScript property that allows us to save key/value pairs in a web browser with no expiration date.

2. What are `cookies`?

- Answer: `cookies` are data, stored in small text files on your computer (they are saved in name-value pairs). 

3. What are the differences between `localStorage` & `sessionStorage`?

- Answer: `localStorage` doesn't expire while `sessionStorage` only keeps the data until the page session ends (only valid as long as the tab or the browser is open, and survives over page reloads & restores).
